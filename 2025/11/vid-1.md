### Sky's Review:
Starting off with the intro, there is an excessive glow effect that is applied to
the entirety of the video which I personally find too much, especially since it is
also applied on the warnings which is not a good idea from me. A video effect should
not be obscuring important information.

The title is also unreadable, there is too many text effects that are being applied.

Aside from the strong glow, the cycle itself is perfectly fine. It uses the typical
"Glimpsing Infinity" song that is common with supercycle beginnings, which I'm okay
with.

This looks like a remake of the third supercycle from NO!'s
[Numbers 0 to ??? \[3\]](https://youtu.be/Ev0tySdYWis?t=23349) video. As it's a part
of a "number comparisons" series, I'm not gonna judge the cycle entries too harshly.

The supercycle repeats is where things start getting interesting, using a different
song, not being birds but rather something more energetic and techno-feeling, which
I like.

Repeat effects starts off with a primitive glow before transitioning to a very red
and very bass-boosted segment by NewFall, more in line with Supercycle #4 of ??? [3]
rather then Supercycle #3. The transition is a harsh cutoff, which I'm mostly meh
about.

Putting off the AE version for a moment, I like how they didn't use a typical square
bracket to wrap the number and used a different kind that has the bottom clamps
missing. Small details like that I do appereciate.

The entries can be hard to see as the colors blend into the AE, which I don't
particularly like. I suggest that they have used contrasting borders that are
different from the inner text fill when designing entry styles, but that's just a
nitpick.

Normal layers after the repeat, typical. However, the audio seems to break as I
can't hear the video for most of the layers, and when I do I hear this very deep,
bassy sound. A bit strange.

Layer patterns are certainly nice, there's some deviations from the normal patterns
I've seen with most layers and also gives a nice fractral pattern.

I don't know how to describe this, but the speeding up and zooming up near the end of
the layer set is also a nice touch that builds up feeling for the next layer set.

Superlayers are slow, not begrudgingly so but more like a nitpick. I would've prefered
faster layers but the current speed is still okay. Also, at some parts of the layer set,
it gets quite difficult to actually see the layer patterns until it starts brightening.

Back to the layers, using multiple dot separators to show the nested brackets level in
the name itself is a decent idea and works well. The asteriek operator being used to
represent the different symbol separators also works well.

Now, the megalayers. The third layer set has some of the most interesting uses of effects
I've seen done for layers so far, and wow it is creative and I love it. It's also quite
speedy which is a nice bonus.

And then we have the progression segment, which is a nice idea. However, I would've liked
it more if you first sped up and quickly repeated the layer sets before putting the bars
on screen, as well as applying a bit of shaking on those bars. Overall, nice touch.

I did find it awkward though that after "Ending..." it reverted back to the beginning with
no sort of transition effect. I would recommend you apply the same pattern of bars on top
of the existing ones instead of lazily looping the video.

A few moments of casual speed ups before we get to a new number ("Capacity Limit of Capacity Limit")
and the audio and video getting much more chaotic. [This segment](https://youtu.be/XmnMZQvEZpg?t=1443)
that was made by Polstok honestly reminds me a lot of what I would do for A.E. versions,
especially of his use of the classic filmora effects I recongize. I like the familar feeling.

Then it sort of turns, well I don't really know how to describe it. Like a very chaotic
A.E. version, it sort of goes all over the place and you can't really understand the pattern.
The audio sort of then starts hollowing out and sounds very windy. Again, while the video
goes all over the place, sort of giving me a JoshuaDR.0809-style A.E. vibe.

nvm i'm not finishing the rest of the review
