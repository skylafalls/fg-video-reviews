## Reviews:
### William's Review:
Added a lot of creativity into the simple act of classification breaking.

### Zerena's Review:
Looking at this video, There may have been a few slip ups here and there but compared to Part XIV,
it's a Major Improvement! There's much less Breakslop and Freddie actually decides to do something
interesting for once, a Xenocycle Section! 3 Xenocycles in a row for the first time in Series History,
which Finishes off with a Hyperpowered Xenocycle.

In said Xenocycle Section, I can tell the creativity has turned up a notch!
Despite the repetiviveness of the corruption cycles... like that's the 3rd
episode in a row where there's an episode involving Corrupting the video and
cycling that. But at least it ends in a creative way with Corruptions reminiscent
of the Mojiboid Cycle in EATTEOFG [16/20].

The Untypables are some of the best in this entire series so far. I love the way they were designed.
The Music choice could be a little strange sometimes, but it doesn't matter.
Either way, this is honestly a really great FG VIdeo and may be the start of BTEON's Redemption Arc.

The Only Gripes i have with this that lower it down a little:
- It copies the Mathis Part XIV Black Hole (Thankfully not a Video Rip)
- It sorta copies the Beyond ???? S2EP3 Number Reveal (Same thing but it Doesn't matter if it came the same day)

And that's pretty much it

### Sky's Review:
Already starting off strong with something that is straight out of Mathis's section 2.

I like the ambience that is presented within this video, a calming sensation with a retro style. The symbols also looks pretty good, a mix of nice untypables and decent unicodes for the Orkinal Levels breakings.
The text styling is also pretty good, could use better contrast however.

Names are, not the best for OkL < 10^10 but after that Orkinal Level, starts to get more original and unique, so nice improvement.
