# Contribution Guide
This is not the official way to review videos. However, Sky will forward your reviews from here to the review team for further consideration.

Firstly, you should [make an issue](https://github.com/skylafalls/fg-video-reviews/issues) for what video you want to review. We will discuss the video there. If it gets accepted, you or us will review the video.

Please note the following types of content will not be reviewed and will be automatically denied:
- It is under 3 minutes long (excluding any intros or credits)
- It violates YouTube Community Guidelines (or the rules of other platforms it’s hosted on)
- It is age-restricted (most of us are teenagers and cannot look at age-restricted videos)
- It has no sound
- It isn’t related to fictional googology (this is an FG video review system, not just a general one)
  - Videos that have A.E. versions or reaches Absolute Infinity as its goal doesn't fall under this.
  - Example: Spinning to Absolute Infinity RPM is mythic.
- It has less than 30 entries (only for number-focused videos)
- The large majority of the video is copied from other creators (we will not review stealers)

## Rating Criterias
There's a specific way you need to review your videos. You need to give a rating tier (see below) and a score out of 10.
You may go above a score of 10 if you believe it deserves it.

The 5 main criteria to consider when rating a video are:
- Content (the actual stuff included)
- Design (how it looks, styled)
- Effects (the stuff applied on the content)
- Creativity (how original/unique the content is)
- Execution (how it's done and shown)

Here are some general guidelines for each of the criteria:

### Content:
- Are the numbers themselves good?
  - Consider their names, functions (if it makes sense, how complex),
    symbols used (typable unicodes + untypables), but not their decorations.
  - You do not need good looking entries to be good entries.
- Are the cycle entries themselves good?
  - Are they related? Are they just ____ized spam?
- Are the AE entries themselves good?
- Are the timings right?
  - Are they dragging something too long? Could something have lasted longer?
- Do some things seem like they don’t fit in an FG video?
  - Is that the right style for this section?

### Design:
- Do the entries look good?
  - Consider stuff like the colors, outline, glow, effects, backgrounds, etc.
- Are the transitions good?
  - Between entries? Between cycle frames? Between A.E. segments?
- Are the sounds well-designed?
  - Right music for the mood? Right intensity for the cycles or A.Es?
- Does the A.E. look good?
  - Good layer patterns? Good videos in the video layers? Not a pain to observe?
- Do the entries stand out against the background?
  - Entries should be distinguishable from the cycle/A.E/video backgrounds.
  - They shouldn't be obscured by effects unless necessary.

### Creativity:
- Was the concept done before? Rarely used, or commonly found?
  - Does the video overuse “done-to-death” concepts (such as Breakology, or Birds in a supercycle)?
- How unique is the layout of the video? What about the cycles and AEs?
- Is the video trying too hard to be like someone else?
- Does the video’s quality seem carried by a particular segment?
  - This includes layers, entries, AEs, cycles, etc.
- Do the numbers and cycles fit a similar theme? Is it related to the events that happened?

### Execution:
- Are the ideas of the video executed well? Could it have been executed better?
  - How could have it been done?
- How polished is the video? Does it look like the quality was checked multiple times or never checked?
  - Having a watermark should not affect the rating. We have people that cannot afford good editing software.
- **If there is a story**: Is it well-written? Are there images or animations to go along with it?
  - Is it also original, and unique? Or just a ripoff of someone else?

## Rating Tiers
Based off of Geometry Dash's rating system.

- Unrated:
  - Range: 0-5/10
- Rated:
  - Range: 5-7/10
- Featured:
  - Range: 7-8/10
- Epic:
  - Range: 8-9/10
- Legendary:
  - Range: 9-10/10
- Mythic:
  - Range: 10+/10

We intentionally do not limit outselves at 10/10, cause there is no such thing as a "perfect" FG video.
- Every integer increase however should be much harder to reach then the last rating.
