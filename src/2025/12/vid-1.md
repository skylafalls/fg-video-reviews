### Sky's Review:
Already, I am liking the cutscenes that brings reasoning behind what would be a random project otherwise.
Also, the expressions are kinda funny, so extra points there.

Now, the filmora watermark obviously gets in the way of the A.E. version but I'm going to disregard that
as I know you (Joshua) won't be able to get rid of it anytime soon.

Good speed also, not too slow and not too fast. The effects are also very chaotic with some sort of
a ??? [???] style, which I've known for Joshua to do.

Now, the unique parts of the video I've seen firstly is the shockwave effects from how aggressively the Joshua
ball jumps back and forth. Pretty nice, pretty unique, I like the idea.
Small nitpick but, I've would have appreciated maybe a different way of displaying the shockwaves?
Something that sort of quickly zooms through instead of relying on Filmora's blur effect thing.

Ah, the energy shields. That's also a pretty unique concept I like, the idea of manifesting a forcefield by
sheer force and power. That, I like.

Side note: there seems to be a small drop in power right after the shields show up but then it gets regained
quickly. Interesting behavior.

Now level 4, that's also where the glitches start showing up. Honestly, I thought they would have shown up earlier,
but not disappointed regardless.

One thing I have a slight problem with is that I don't see the Joshua ball actually jumping up and down.
It's just the A.E. version, although considering the power, I can understand.

Also, why is "Jump" and "Heat" capitalized? Some of the captializations are weird, but not enough to actually affect its rating.

Oooh, now level 5 is where the layers show up, which I personally don't think fits in a video where you jump up and down so quickly you obliterate the entire A_0 (those who know). But that's my opinions. The layers are still pretty good regardless.

What isn't just my opinions however is that most of the BAN values are incorrect, especially after {10, 10 [1 \ 2] 2}. That feels like something you could have caught before exporting, but it's fine.

> "The jumping has gotten to point where its making powerful AE versions"
well no shit? Anyways, the glitchiness are somewhat good too but then it started calming down which, does not make sense for something this chaotic?

After this, it feels like it started getting more generic with how it's shown, with the same effects again and again.
Yeah, after 20-25 ish minutes I am getting bored of the A.E. version. It's still pretty good (the static section too), but like, it's a bit boring you know?

After the limit of BAN is where I'm starting to get interested again, as I now see that we're breaking time. Don't think we've done this before, except maybe LENS part 20B. Again, after a while it gets tiring again but I do like the concepts you added.

The transition between the finite entries and the infinite is pretty interesting. I haven't seen something collapse on itself and then implode to get to the next segment. Neat way to progress to "the next realm".

Ah, and the jumping ball is back, glowing brighter then ever before, representing transcendence perhaps. Nice.

And the finals? About what I expected. On par with other stuff I have seen from Joshua. That was quite a morbid ending however.

## SUMMARY:
- Video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P76u-QFdhLg>
- Rating: **Feature**

Numerical Rating / 10: 7.47/10

Reasoning:
- The video was somewhat interesting, having traditional modern-style A.E. versions mixed with new concepts
  to keep it engaging and entertaining.
- Like with most A.E. version videos, it gets pretty boring quickly but Joshua added enough unique content
  to avoid that pitfall.
- Overall, **featured**.
