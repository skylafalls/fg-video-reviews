## Reviews:
### William's Review:
Added a lot of creativity into the simple act of classification breaking.

### Zerena's Review:
Looking at this video, There may have been a few slip ups here and there but compared to Part XIV,
it's a Major Improvement! There's much less Breakslop and Freddie actually decides to do something
interesting for once, a Xenocycle Section! 3 Xenocycles in a row for the first time in Series History,
which Finishes off with a Hyperpowered Xenocycle.

In said Xenocycle Section, I can tell the creativity has turned up a notch!
Despite the repetiviveness of the corruption cycles... like that's the 3rd
episode in a row where there's an episode involving Corrupting the video and
cycling that. But at least it ends in a creative way with Corruptions reminiscent
of the Mojiboid Cycle in EATTEOFG [16/20].

The Untypables are some of the best in this entire series so far. I love the way they were designed.
The Music choice could be a little strange sometimes, but it doesn't matter.
Either way, this is honestly a really great FG VIdeo and may be the start of BTEON's Redemption Arc.

The Only Gripes i have with this that lower it down a little:
- It copies the Mathis Part XIV Black Hole (Thankfully not a Video Rip)
- It sorta copies the Beyond ???? S2EP3 Number Reveal (Same thing but it Doesn't matter if it came the same day)

And that's pretty much it

### Sky's Review:
Already starting off strong with something that is straight out of Mathis's section 2.

I like the ambience that is presented within this video, a calming sensation with a retro style. The symbols also looks pretty good, a mix of nice untypables and decent unicodes for the Orkinal Levels breakings.
The text styling is also pretty good, could use better contrast however.

Names are, not the best for OkL < 10^10 but after that Orkinal Level, starts to get more original and unique, with good font combinations too, so nice improvement.

Small note: The Ender of Numbers was already used back in BTEON part 1. So...

Ah, I haven't seen someone use a right arrow in a function to denote nesting. Most of us use the X notation so, nice job Freddie. Or Zerena. Or Stella. Or Alexandre. Or whoever put that there.

And then you used the analogous operator, for like the 50th time. Still pretty good. Also "pretty good" is NOT putting the "S" in front of the OkL, although that's just laziness at that point.

Number names again, certainly interesting, and weird. Although, I like the weirdness of the names. Makes each segment a little less generic. The decorations around the number names are again, a bit interesting, and weird.

Small recommendation: don't put the Numkertomin / Class values at the bottom if the values won't change between entries. You shouldn't add redundant text, just saying.

Okay, I kinda expected unicode symbols for the 3rd orkinal function and operators, not just standard ASCII symbols so I'm slightly underwhelmed, considering the other symbols used in this episode.

"Beyond the Orkinals" is a bit generic but not surprising considering the series I'm reviewing right now. Nice bracket types you got there though.

Ah, now Xenocycle #27 is where things starts to get interesting for me. The "RANDOMIZING!" cycle frames certainly are unique, but I don't see how it's related to Orkinals, or breaking them.
The "Incentivizing" cycle frames does make sense and do fit, I like those.

Okay, I think the effects are applied too early (especially the Radio Explike FX you used),
I think the audio should be distorted a little bit first. I do like the numeric null part,
and I am so thankful it didn't end with an explosion (like The Ultimate Rebirth segment).

Now for the segment after, the symbols are pretty good alongside their names, and I'm glad you decided to knock out every other Or_inal letter comboination so we don't have to see Orxinal, Orzinal, and stuff in later episodes. I don't want them to be extremely overused, just like how Numker is.

For Xenocycle #29, it kinda looks like a copy of Xenocycle #13? I'm not quite sure what the exact number is, but I definitely know I've seen this before, and I kinda don't like things being reused without enough time passing.

I also wished the corruption part didn't progress into a cycle and instead went straight into an A.E. version, I feel like that could've been a better transition, but oh well. You did come back with the "corrupting the ordinals" zooming part, which I do like that it's a bit more unique then usual TEON concepts.

> Side note: was the reference to Jeffery Epstein intentional when the number was called "The Epsteimologia"?

Okay, I gotta say the 30th Xenocycle is a lot better then the previous ones. The rings of metaphysics, the directional thrusts, those are pretty unique and interesting ideas I haven't seen anyone do, and I love it. Props to whoever added that. And please find a different song other then Hyperloop for powered cycles/supercycles, I'm getting bored.

I also think the dimensional thrust part could've transitioned into a full A.E. instead of, breaking the count. Seems, a bit weird? The shapes in the cycle frames are definitely quite cool though.

Now uh, why are we still using Mythie and Mathie in the big '25? You should find a different word, but for this segment I think it fits.

And DAMN, those layers are quite impressive. I love some of the patterns, like the grid looking things, idk what you call them. And the orbiting ones too? Holy shit. The A.E. version was typical, so no comment.

One last thing, was the black hole segment copied from Mathis's part 14? And the shattering to review the final number seems copied from BEYOND ??? S2E3 also. Strange.
